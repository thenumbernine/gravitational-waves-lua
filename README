Numerical simulation of hyperbolic formalisms
Made for getting some numerical relativity demos working

Requires my lua-ext, symmath-lua, and optionally lua-glapp, and the Malkia UFO ffi lua files for the OpenGL display.
There's a text-based version you can uncomment that will run it to the command-line if you don't want to bother set up the GL stuff.

adm2d3var.lua is based on my attempt to implement the formalism described in Alcubierre's "Introduction to 3+1 Numerical Relativity".
Specifically, a 3-variable hyperbolic system with lapse (alpha) and metric (g) separated from the state variable computations.
It doesn't work.

adm2d5var.lua is a hyperbolic sim based on Alcubierre's "The appearance of coordinate shocks in hyperbolic formalisms of General Relativity"
found here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9609015v2.pdf

adm2dspherical.lua is the spherical solution in the same paper mentioned above.
Figured out that the paper's, "eigenfields" is an inner product with the variable basis and the rows that make up the inverse eigenvector matrix.

euler1d.lua is the Euler hydrodynamic equations I used as a test-case to verify the Roe solver was working.  Good ol' Euler fluid equations.

maxwell.lua is Maxwell equations described as hyperbolic equations in section 4.3 of Trangenstein's "Numerical Solutions of Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations"
